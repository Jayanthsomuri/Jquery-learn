      The selectors had no choice but to
       give Kohli another go in the Indian 
       side, and this time he strung
        together a number of impressive
         scores. After being given an 
         extended run, he repaid their 
         faith by notching up his maiden
         DI hundred in an impressive run-chase against Sri Lanka in December 2009 - his 
         first of many exemplary knocks in run-chases. In the World Cup final of 2011, the biggest stage of them all, Kohli, along with his Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, pulled off a largely underrated rescue effort with an 83-run stand after losing the openers early. This knock played a crucial role in setting the platform for MS Dhoni's fabled knock of 91*, which eventually won India the World Cup on that
         enchanting evening in Mumbai.
